FSM mk2 is FastDrum with portholes:
* cylindrical reactor with 20% LEU and lead chessboard lattice;
* 0 to 3 portholes at midplane;
* in preparation for adding central volume of NU salt in the core.

We need up to 3 beam port holes since we may need each for:
* neutrons in from the DD generator (bottom);
* neutrons out to drive the graphite pile (left);
* neutrons out for x-section measurements (right).

For external source simulations you need to set nps card.
